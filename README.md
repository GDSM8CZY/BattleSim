# What is this
This is a game I made for my Python class, where you have to fight an enemy.
This was the first time I used classes, so they don't have any methods

# How to play
- You can select options by typing in the number in parentheses next to the option
- You select your sword and bow before fighting
- You and the enemy have 5 heals each, they heal 5 hp
- I think the enemy does not work as intended, but I am not fixing it because I am working on part 2
